# GCD-and-LCM
You enter 2 numbers and get the GCD or LCM of these numbers.

For example:
Input = 12, 15

for GCD Output = 3

for LCM Output = 60

And I just want to clearify that my codes aren't anything special I just upload them for fun and I use github as a cloud for my codes to never lose them :) HAVE A NÄ°CE DAY
